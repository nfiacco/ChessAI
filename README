Chess AI

March 2016

This is a collection of various chess engines, each an improvement upon the
last.  Within the src directory, you will find several chess engines, named:

RandomAI
MinimaxAI
AlphaBetaAI
TransAI
MTDFAI
KillerAI

This lists them in order of performance, from worst to best.  Furthermore, note
that you can test them by setting the initial position in chessgame.java and
choosing the AI in chessclient.java, where one player should be the human
for maximum control (in positions where there is a guarenteed win for the
computer, resistance is futile).

In order to access the writeup, please refer to the doc directory.

Execution Instructions:
1) clone the repository
2) navigate to the /exec directory
3) run the command: "java -jar <jar file name here>"
4) chess view should open, with keyboard input

Note: performance is most notable in endgame situations, rather than the normal setup
Also note: all executable JARS utilize the fully optimized version of the engine.
